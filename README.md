# LFunWrapper
Android library that acts as a wrapper for LiquidFun. For now, the entire LiquidFun library is not wrapped, only the part that we needed to use have been wrapped. The missing part will be done on demand.

There is a test project that is using the particles the show a liquid falling down on some blocks.
